## ðŸš€ About Me
Since my first contact with development, I have always a very interest to develop layouts, experiences and see analysis and user behavior. In the college, I've always been skewed to code in the back-end, but my desire is to have contact with the final user, the usability and others datas.

Among my experience, used diverse technologies: Web development (HTML, css and prÃ© processors, JS and tests auto, React and other technologies used in front-end development.

In my current experience, we think a lot about performance, user experience and best practices in write our codes.

Technologies used: HTML (Jekyll), CSS (Stylus, emotion, styled-components, Bootstrap), Javascript (React, react-testing-library, jQuery), Test Automation (Jest, react-tests) (Unit Tests, TDD) Gatsby, Git, Google AMP

Platforms used: Google Optmize, Github, Jira
